            <p>
                Breka Bakery is a local family business born in 2006 at Fraser and 49th, in the lively
                neighbourhood of Sunset. We took over a well-established German bakery and have stayed true to its
                roots, while
                expanding its offer. Our “Bienenstich”, family sized apple strudel and freshly baked artisan rye breads
                (among
                others) are still made following some of the original recipes.
